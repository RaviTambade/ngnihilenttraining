Good morning, try this:

if I have latest version angular cli install 20 and I want to create angular 17 application , what do I do

If you currently have **Angular CLI 20** installed globally but want to **create an Angular 17 application**, you‚Äôll need to use a compatible version of the CLI ‚Äî either temporarily downgrade it or use a local (project-specific) CLI installation. Angular projects are tightly coupled to their CLI major version.

Here‚Äôs how you can do it cleanly:

***

### Option 1: Use `npx` to target Angular 17 CLI (recommended)
This allows you to generate an Angular 17 app without uninstalling your global CLI.

```bash
npx @angular/cli@17 new my-angular17-app
```

This command:
- Downloads **Angular CLI v17** temporarily.
- Creates a new project using that version.
- Ensures your dependencies align with Angular 17.

After creation, you can confirm it‚Äôs Angular 17 by running:
```bash
cd my-angular17-app
ng version
```

***

### Option 2: Temporarily downgrade your global Angular CLI
If you prefer using `ng new` directly, uninstall your current CLI and install v17 globally.

```bash
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm install -g @angular/cli@17
```

Then create your Angular 17 project:
```bash
ng new my-angular17-app
```

Once the app is created, if you wish, reinstall your latest (Angular 20) CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

You can always use the locally installed CLI via:
```bash
npx ng serve
```

***

### Option 3: Edit package.json manually
If you already created a project with Angular 20, you can manually edit the versions in your `package.json` to match Angular 17 (e.g., `@angular/core`, `@angular/cli`, etc.), then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This is more error-prone and not recommended unless you‚Äôre comfortable resolving dependency mismatches.

### Summary Table

| Method | Affects Global Setup | Simplicity | Recommended? |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `npx @angular/cli@17 new` | No | ‚úÖ Easy | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `npm install -g @angular/cli@17` | Yes | Moderate | ‚öôÔ∏è Optional |
| Manual `package.json` Edit | No | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex | ‚ùå No |

## Todays Training  Task for two hours

Create a ProductComponent.
Give it properties: title, price, likes, imageURL.
Embed a CounterComponent inside ProductComponent.
Bind likes as [count] to the child component.
Test: clicking + increases likes dynamically.
üîπ Outcome: A fully nested, dynamic, reusable component setup.
Kindly revise three days  understanding  from 

Nested Component

#### **Problem Statement**
You are working on an e-commerce web app where each product has its own details and user interactions. Your task is to create two connected components that demonstrate **parent-child communication** through Angular‚Äôs **@Input** and **@Output** properties.

The goal is to display a product with its title, price, image, and ‚Äúlikes‚Äù count ‚Äî and to make the likes count dynamically increase when the user clicks a ‚Äú+‚Äù button.

#### **Requirements**
1. **Create a parent component:** `ProductComponent`
   - Properties:
     - `title` (string)
     - `price` (number)
     - `likes` (number)
     - `imageURL` (string)
   - This component should display the product‚Äôs details and include a child counter component.

2. **Create a child component:** `CounterComponent`
   - Input: `count` (number)
   - Output: an event when the ‚Äú+‚Äù button is clicked to update likes in the parent.

3. **Bind Data**
   - Use `[count]="likes"` to pass the likes count from `ProductComponent` to `CounterComponent`.
   - When the counter increments, it should notify the parent, which updates and re-renders the likes.

4. **Test Your Work**
   - Display one sample product in your app.
   - Clicking the ‚Äú+‚Äù button should increase the likes count dynamically without page refresh.
   - Ensure binding updates correctly in both parent and child components.

#### **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**
- Display a list of multiple products using `*ngFor`.
- Add a ‚ÄúLike All‚Äù button in the parent container that increases likes for all products.

#### **Expected Outcome**
A working, **reusable**, and **dynamic** Angular setup demonstrating:
- Parent-to-child communication via `@Input`
- Child-to-parent communication via `@Output`
- Two-way interactive data updates in real time.
